**Web Forum Program**

** make sure all new files are added under the "mini-project" directory.... Else Xcode will have a siezure **

This repository contains a web forum application developed using Swift and Xcode. The goal of this project is to provide a platform for users to engage in discussions, create posts, and interact with one another in a structured forum environment. There is an initializer that has been commented out, when first setting up this application you may need to uncomment, build and run, and then quickly close and comment it out again to save only one copy of the initial data. From there, you can log into the application using any of the following logins:
Username: Alice      Password: alicePass123
Username: Bob        Password: bobSecret456
Username: Charlie    Password: charlie789    [Admin Login]

Under the admin login, you will be able to delete the existing posts/comments. You may log out, and view existing posts/comments, and after logging in you can add your own. 

In order to run this app, you will need a Mac Device with XCode installed. Ensure that the SwiftData, Cryptokit, and other imported libraries and existent and properly targetted before building and running the simulation.
